CAPSTONE PROJECT REPORT
(Project Term January-May, 2014)
 
PROFILE

This project is basically developed for file storage and file synchronization at the cloud server. We can easily access the files over network through internet facility from cloud server.
Main problems which we were facing regarding access files and storage data for which we carried hard disks, pan drives, like all the data which we have need to carry it with us. If we want to share the data with other users then we were not be able to share with them for which we have to approach to them.
Actually we were doing everything manually earlier so there were many problems regarding storage data. Because data cannot be managed manually properly there were many chances of reduction of data, problem of synchronization, it takes very much time to locate the data, etc. we have overcome those problems of users by this project.
Digital form came for overcome this problem of manually management of data, it is very helpful for users, it takes less time rather than earlier manually process, because all works depends on cloud network. From where we can easily download, upload the data from everywhere and also at every time. Cloud computing is central repository in which multiple users can easily get access from multiple locations at the same time.  
So we have developed it for solving that problem, in this there is no need to carry the data with us because we can store our data at the cloud server through which we can easily access our data through internet. Even we can easily share the data with others users through the online send the data to them so there is no need to approach them for sharing.   


WHATS NEW
1 Responsive design
In our system we have applied responsive web design (RWD) approach and build a website with responsive framework. By doing so the content, images and structure of the site responds to the screen size of the device that is accessing it. This means that our site will look similar in any device, and when there is less room, the structure of the page changes to fit the new space the site is contained in.

2 Better look and feel of user interface
We have provided good interface in our project so that by look wise our project is totally different with other existing drives.
We have used CSS, HTML5 for creating shadows, textures, and gradients for 3D look. So that our designing of project could be better.
Look and Feel is a term which is used in respect of graphical user interface and comprises aspects of its design including elements such as colors, shapes, layout (“look”) etc. as well as we have also provided the behavior of dynamic elements such as different types of buttons, boxes, images and menus (“feel”).

3	AJAX
An acronym for AJAX is Asynchronous JavaScript and XML is a group of interrelated Web development techniques used on the client-side to create asynchronous Web applications.
In our project we have used Ajax functionality because, our webpages of project can sends the request to server then server will responds to that client at background.
There is no need to refresh whole page for every user interaction. When the Ajax interaction is complete, JavaScript updates the HTML source of the pages. In our project the changes are made very frequently without requiring whole page refresh.
Ajax interactions can be used to do things such as validate form entries (while the user is entering them) using server-side logic, retrieve detailed data from the server, dynamically update data on a page, and submit partial forms from the page.

4	Profile pic in  our drive
In our project we can apply profile pic in the project profile. Which is totally different from other existing drives. In other drives like Google drive, onebox, dropbox etc there is no option regarding profile pic and update the profile.
 In our project user can login their account and can be able to update the profile pic and also       their information will be display with that profile pic. This feature is unique feature of our project with existing drives.
